How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

More often than not, I find engaging with stakeholders and surveyind end users is one of the best ways to collect information that can be used to totally understand the needs of the user and then apply those needs into the features of a program or whole application. User stories give a more humanistic approach to doing so, in that it literally is stated from the view of the user. For example, "I as a user want to see a list of destinations when I click a button" sets up just enough information for the development team and testers to implement said feature into the program.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Usually my main approach to developing a program involves not really doing much of any actual coding until I have a clear layout and fleshed out set of ideas, even before I begin to set up user stories or any sort of Kanban board. In the future I hope that the general state of communication amongst any team that I am on or that I lead is up to par with Scrum practices. A feedback driven, goal oriented, and clearly laid out process is my goal. One of the practices I picked up over the course was utilizing seemingly small ideas, such as the two pizza rule, and poker planning, in order to compartmentalize teamwork and utilize interesting methods of getting people engaged in their work. I'd love to apply those to a team in the future and see the effects firsthand.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member means not only knowing your role, but also understanding how your role combines with the other members of your team in order to create a synergy that is productive and adaptive. For example, a development team member may not be the one making up or writing all of the tests, but they understand that the tester is going to be working with them in order to establish a set of guidelines for how the project will be coded based on their various tests, such as whether a slideshow application is going to operate using arrow buttons on both sides of the screen, or a singular two button interface in the corner of the screen.
